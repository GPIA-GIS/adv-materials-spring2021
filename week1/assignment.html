                <h2>Part 1: Carto</h2>
                <p>Let's get started with Carto. This part of the assignment is only required if you are new to Carto.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>If you haven't already, create an account at Carto with <a href="https://thenewschool.carto.com/signup">this link</a> and your @newschool.edu email address.</li>
                    <li>Work through Carto's tutorials <a href="https://carto.com/learn/guides/intro/getting-started-with-carto-builder">Getting started with Carto builder</a> and <a href="https://carto.com/learn/guides/styling/style-by-value">Style by value</a>. We will be talking about this more in class, so don't worry if it doesn't fully click right away.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Submit a <strong>public URL</strong> to a map that you make using Carto while working through these lessons as proof that you worked through them.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Part 2: Your own Carto map</h2>
                <p>Now that you have some experience with Carto, create your own map with Carto:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Start with some data. You might have data from previous GIS work you can use or you might want to do a quick search for some data.</li>
                    <li>Add the data as a dataset to Carto.</li>
                    <li>Add the dataset to a new map in Carto and style it.</li>
                    <li>Feel free to experiment with other Carto features and add some to the map.</li>
                    <li>Publish the map publicly.</li>
                </ol>
