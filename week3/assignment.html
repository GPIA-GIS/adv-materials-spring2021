        <p>An <a id="" href="https://gpia-gis.github.io/adv-materials-spring2017/week3/materials/sql-cheatsheet.pdf">SQL Reference</a> (pdf)</p>
        <p><a class="" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_kNe24cO18">video: Analysis in Carto</a></p>
        <p><a class="" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaZrKti3G-8">video: SQL in Carto</a></p>
        <p>Carto has numerous tutorials on working with data and <a href="https://carto.com/academy/courses/sql-postgis/intro-to-sql-and-postgis/">SQL</a>.</p>
        <p>If you want to learn more about SQL in general (outside of Carto and mapping), <a href="http://sqlschool.modeanalytics.com/">SQL School</a> is a good place to start.</p>
        <p>Please create a post in <a href="https://piazza.com/class/k5juwa8yx4l1eo">Piazza</a> for any technical questions.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Part 1: SQL</h2>
        <p>Write at least <strong>five</strong> different SQL statements for datasets in your Carto account. Base them on a variety of the queries under Common Queries in the <a href="https://gpia-gis.github.io/adv-materials-spring2020/week3/materials/sql-cheatsheet.pdf">SQL Reference</a>. Some should be mappable and some should be unmappable (eg, selecting the <code>COUNT</code> of a table, since that cannot be mapped).</p>
        <p>Submit:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the SQL that you performed,</li>
          <li>what you wanted to find with the SQL, and</li>
          <li>the output of the SQL, either a screenshot of the resulting dataset or of the map, as appropriate.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h2>Part 2: SQL, Inside Airbnb</h2>
        <p>Using SQL and <a href="http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html">data from Inside Airbnb</a> for the city of your choice (find the city, then download the <strong>listings.csv</strong>) answer the following questions:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>How many Airbnb listings are there in the city you chose?</li>
          <li>How many listings are there in each neighborhood?</li>
          <li>What is the average price for an listing?</li>
          <li>Make a map where you filter the listings somehow (for example, showing listings with "quaint" in their name versus those with "cozy" in the name).</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Part 3: Readings</h2>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week we briefly look at the often-contentious realm of crime mapping:</span></p>
        <ul>
          <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take a look at the NYPD's official crime map and data dashboard, </span><a href="https://compstat.nypdonline.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CompStat 2.0</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For some context, either <a href="https://urbanomnibus.net/2018/06/policing-is-an-information-business/">read this take predictive policing</a> or listen to a few episodes of the podcast Reply All (<a href="https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/o2hx34/127-the-crime-machine-part-i">part I</a>, <a href="https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/n8hwl7/128-the-crime-machine-part-ii#episode-player">part II</a>).<br /></span></li>
          <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many crime maps focus on violent or drug-related crimes, but what if you were concerned about white collar crimes happening in the neighborhood? Maybe you'll find the <a href="https://whitecollar.thenewinquiry.com/">White Collar Crime Risk Zones</a> map of use! Check out the map, and read through the <a href="https://whitecollar.thenewinquiry.com/static/whitepaper.pdf">methodology</a>.<br /></span></li>
        </ul>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we'll be talking about these next week in class, please do respond on <a href="https://piazza.com/class/k5juwa8yx4l1eo">Piazza</a><a href="https://groups.google.com/a/newschool.edu/forum/#!forum/gpia-advanced-gis-spring-2019-group"></a>.</span></p>

        <h2>Part 4: HTML Preparation</h2>
        <p>Finally, next week we will begin talking about HTML. Please create a (free) <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> account before coming to class. Unlike Carto, it doesn't matter if you use your New School email account or not--up to you. You don't have to do anything with it yet, just be prepared to log in when you need to.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Submitting your work</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Part 1: submit SQL used and the resulting screenshots.</li>
          <li>Part 2: submit SQL used and the answers you received.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please include a short paragraph response or summary of your work.</p>
