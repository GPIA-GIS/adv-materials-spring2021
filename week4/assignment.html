                <p>We talked about HTML this week, and we'll exercise some of our new knowledge around it by using HTML to customize Carto maps and make our own pages. <strong>Please do not use CSS (styles) for now. Focus on HTML for this assignment.</strong></p>

                <h1>Resources</h1>
                <ol>
                    <li>My <a id="" href="https://gpia-gis.github.io/adv-materials-spring2020/week4/materials/html_cheatsheet.pdf">HTML Reference</a> should get you started.</li>
                    <li>If you're looking to learn HTML from another angle, <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html">codecademy</a> has a course in HTML that is usable and interactive.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://marksheet.io/">MarkSheet</a> has a good free HTML tutorial.</li>
                    <li>If you're looking for a resource on HTML that you can read through, I'd recommend the first three chapters of <a href="https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/">HTML &amp; CSS is Hard</a>. For now I would stick with editing code in Glitch, so you can skip the parts that mention a text editor named Atom.</li>
                    <li>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla Developer Network</a> is a great resource for HTML and other web documentation.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://css-tricks.com/">css-tricks</a> has good beginner-to-intermediate tutorials, and you might appreciate <a href="https://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/58-html-css-the-very-basics/">HTML &amp; CSS -- The VERY Basics</a>. As stated earlier, please stick to HTML for now and we'll cover CSS next week.</li>

                <h2>Part 1: Add some HTML to a Carto map</h2>
                <p>Open a Carto map from a previous assignment (or work on a new one toward your project) and:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Edit the legend to add a link (or links) to your datasource(s).</li>
                    <li>Make a change to the HTML for the pop-ups for your map. This can be as simple as adding <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> elements to emphasize some text, or you could link to other pages or show images. Use <a class="" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBDaEG-gxc0">this video</a> for some pointers. Ignore the CSS for now!</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Please focus on making meaningful and presentable changes to your map.</p>
            </section>

                    <li>Edit the HTML page (<strong>index.html</strong>):
                        <ul>
                            <li>embed the Carto map from Part 1 in the page as an <code>iframe</code></li>
                            <li>add some text</li>
                            <li>add at least one image</li>
                            <li>add at least one link</li>
                            <li>experiment with some other HTML tags as outlined in the HTML Reference</li>
